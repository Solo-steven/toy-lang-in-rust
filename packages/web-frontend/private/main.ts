            "As a developer, writing code every day is a common occurrence for me. For me, writing code every day is a form of self-improvement and even a leisure activity. However, as I continue on this path of programming, I slowly began to question how programming languages actually work and why browsers and NodeJS can understand JS code. I became curious about how programming languages are understood by runtime systems.",
            "In this series of articles, we will start by introducing some basic academic definitions of programming languages (CFG) and teach you how to use Rust and LLVM to create your own programming language. If you don't understand CFG or LLVM, don't worry, I will do my best to explain these concepts in a clear and simple manner. However, I will not explain the syntax of Rust, so I hope you have a basic understanding of Rust before reading these articles."
